üöÄ Hybrid and Blockchain-based Crowdsourced Framework for Time- and Budget-Constrained Last Mile Delivery

## üß© Abstract

This research series addresses the problem of **Last Mile Delivery (LMD)** under **time-critical** and **budget-constrained** environments. With the rapid growth of e-commerce, LMD has become a primary bottleneck in delivery efficiency due to factors such as **travel distance**, **service cost**, and **delivery time**. Traditional approaches focus on route optimization and profit maximization but overlook the simultaneous challenges of **urgency** and **limited resources**.

To tackle these issues, the first phase introduced the **Hybrid, Crowdsourced, Auction-based LMD (HCA-LMD)** framework ‚Äî a dynamic, auction-driven system that optimizes delivery of **time-sensitive** and **budget-limited** tasks. The framework utilizes **distributed crowdworkers**, dynamically allocating tasks based on **urgency**, **drop-off location**, **worker pricing**, and **reputation**.

Extensive simulations demonstrated that HCA-LMD achieves:
- ‚úÖ **92% on-time deliveries**  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **~50% reduction in average delay**  
- üí∞ **Up to 5.8√ó profit improvement** over state-of-the-art benchmarks  

Building on these results, the second phase introduces the **Blockchain Hybrid Crowdsourced Auction-based LMD (BHCA-LMD)** framework, extending HCA-LMD with **blockchain technology** for **transparency**, **decentralization**, and **trust**. It integrates **drones** and **ground vehicles** for hybrid delivery, incorporates an **on-chain auctioning system** to mitigate low-budget task failures, and implements a **feedback mechanism** to counter malicious behavior.  

Evaluation shows that BHCA-LMD achieves:
- üöö **Up to 74% on-time task completion** even under malicious conditions  
- ‚ö° **15% lower gas consumption** compared to leading benchmarks  

Together, **HCA-LMD** and **BHCA-LMD** establish a **scalable**, **secure**, and **efficient** foundation for next-generation LMD systems operating under stringent time and budget constraints.
